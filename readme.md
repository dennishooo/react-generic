# Intermediate Typescript usage with React

## “keyof”

use it to generate types from keys of another type

## “as const”

use it to signal to typescript to treat an array or an object as a constant. Use it with combination with “type of” to generate actual type from it.

## “typeof”

same as normal javascript “typeof”, but operates on types rather than values

## Type['attr'] or Type[number]

those are indexed types, use them to access subtypes in an Object or an Array respectively

## argName is Type

`type predicate`, use it to turn a function into a safeguard
